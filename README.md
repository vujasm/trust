A prototype implementation of a COMPOSE trust computation engine. The engine computes a trust score or does trust filtering for services and service objects by evaluating their trust-related characteristics in regards to the trust expectations (criteria).  Trust-related characteristics and trust expectations are formally described using the trust semantic vocabulary.  An engine is available as a java archive ( mvn install trusthings-service) and as a web service (mvn install trusthings-webservice) running in Tomcat - with Jersey / JAX-RS.
