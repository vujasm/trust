A prototype implementation of a COMPOSE trust computation engine. The engine computes a trust score for objects and services by evaluating their trust-related characteristics in regards to the trust expectations (criteria). Trust-related characteristics and trust expectations are formally described using the trust semantic vocabulary. An engine is available as a java archive (trusthings-service-X.X.X-jar-with-dependencies.jar) and as a VertX web module (trusthings-vertx-0.2.1-mod.zip).
